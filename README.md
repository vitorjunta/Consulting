# Consulting R Scripts

This repository is a personal collection of **R scripts used in environmental consulting and monitoring**.  
It serves as a way to organize and store scripts I use regularly in my work, including:

- Environmental monitoring of fauna, substrate, and climate in cave environments
- Data analysis and multivariate statistics (community ecology, GLM/GLMM, ANOSIM, DBRDA)  
- Data and results visualization

The repository is structured to keep scripts organized and easy to find, helping me maintain a clear and practical workflow.
